;; - assign-plane                    6 / 6
;;     uses ordering of conditional
;;     clauses to avoid specifying
;;     both upper and lower bound?
;;     prepends "Recommendation: "
;;     in one place rather than
;;     having many copies?

;; - miles-earned                    6 / 6

;; - upgrade                         9 / 9
;;      works off of total
;;      number of
;;      passengers to
;;      simplify
;;      calculation?
;; - seats->letters                  6 / 6
;;      helper function for error
;;      checking?
