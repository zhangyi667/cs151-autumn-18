;; - annual-income                    / 3
;; - hourly-rate                      2/ 3 ;;grader: Something is not quite right. Consider the following test: (check-expect (hourly-rate (Salary 2000 10 35) 40) 10). Your function returns 11 and 3/7. Consider doing it another way where you directly calculate (/ (* ppd periods) 50 i). It doesn't cost that much computation and calling another function like annual-income is more expensive in this case
;; - job=?                            / 3
;; - earnings>?                       3/ 4 ;;grader: you want to replace the 52 with a 50 in your first line
